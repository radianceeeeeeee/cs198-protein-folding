# main.ipynb

This notebook runs everything and it will output the results of all surfaces and their minima-minima pairs into .csv files.

# Other notebooks

### algorithms.ipynb

This notebook contains the function for the Dijkstra's algorithm with weighted absolute energy distance. This function can take any multiplier from 0 to 1 for both uphill and downhill penalties. Moreover, this notebook also contains the function for normalizing the surface so the energy values range from 0 to 1.


### metrics.ipynb

This notebook contains the function that computes the metrics of the path generated by the algorithm given a surface and a minima-minima pair. The following metrics are path length, max height, total cost, path smoothness, max step.


### minima.ipynb

This notebook contains the function to find all the local minima in a given surface.


### plots.ipynb

This notebook contains the helper functions to plot the surfaces along with the path generated by the algorithm.


### preprocess.ipynb

This notebook contains several helper functions that are required so that the data can be easier to plug on functions.


### results.ipynb

The resulting .csv files from main.ipynb is run through this notebook to get the average metrics of every minima-minima pair of all surfaces.
